# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out the QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. This tests basic understanding of HTML and CSS.

Only HTML and CSS was used to tackle this challenge.

Provided designs are located in the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. Figma versions were included but were not made available on Github.

All assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets were already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing all the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.

Project will be deployed using GitHub pages.
